I love getting lost in a book, floating around in some fantasy world devoid of any worries. I started writing because I want to give other people that freedom.

My father is 71 and my mother 61.  We were born quite late to them and then only after ten years of extraordinary efforts that involved uninsured medical costs exceeding $200,000. While my parents have made every effort to save for our education, these savings were limited initially by paying these medical costs and thereafter by the economic downturn.  In the latter, my  father lost 40% of his income, and we experienced serious financial problems.  As a result, I am in need of substantial financial assistance. "

I find myself using writing as an outlet to express my emotions because writing is a therapeutic strategy used to help people cope with problems that are going on in their life.
