# Excel Program

This is an excel program made for Fairfield Scholarship Foundation by Rihcard Zheng.

The program fetches data from the provided links in the csv file and outputs a new csv file that replaces the links with the corresponding data.

## Instructions:

Start by selecting your csv file in your file explorer.

if the program becomes (Not Responding) idle then just wait a few minutes until it is done.

Again, the first textbox is the directory of the original csv file where you can choose the file by pressing the "..." button on the right side of the window.

the second textbox is where you want to store the csv file that the program will generate and make sure to give the file a name (you don't have to type ".csv" for the file name at the end)

Once both textboxes are filled out, it should look something like this:

And all you have to do next is press the Export button and wait for it to generate the csv file depending how big is the original file and how many csv links in it.
(Don't close the program if it becomes Not Responding)



There are a few ways to tell what is the download status of the generated csv file like the pictures shown below.

file size will change(F5 to refresh)

and compare the row number with the original csv file. If there are not the same that means it is still going.

Once the program is done, the Not Responding on the program title will go away and both textboxes are empty
